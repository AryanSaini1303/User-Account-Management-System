**Overview:**
The User Account Management System is a robust web application designed to efficiently manage user accounts and facilitate financial transactions, such as deposits and withdrawals. Built with modern web technologies including React, Apollo Client, and GraphQL, this application ensures a seamless user experience with real-time data updates and an intuitive interface.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Management:**
   - Displays a comprehensive list of users, including their associated accounts and balances.
   - Efficiently queries user data using GraphQL to provide up-to-date information.

2. **Account Transactions:**
   - Allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts.
   - Ensures real-time balance updates through GraphQL mutations and queries.
   - Implements error handling for common issues such as insufficient funds and invalid account IDs.

3. **Dark Mode Support:**
   - Provides a toggle for dark mode, enhancing user comfort during extended use.
   - Utilizes CSS variables to dynamically adjust the application's color scheme.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Designed with a focus on usability across various devices and screen sizes.
   - Implements clean, modern aesthetics with a user-friendly layout.

**Technical Specifications:**

- **Frontend:** Built with React for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
